## This Project helps in taking online test for the candidates on different coding language choosen by candidate itself and knowledge based MCQ.<br/>
## Usage<br/>
   This project can replace the manual and typical machine test procedure for a candidate who has came for the interview process. <br/>
   Entering coding test manually to the Computer can be a tediuos task and same for the code evaluation, this test based platform will ease all these restrictions.<br>
   Creating a test report is also a dicey and time consuming so all these processes will be tackeled by the system.
## Followings are the functionalities which is provided by the platform :<br/>
### (1) From admin point of view admin can:<br/>
        (a) Add and remove candidates.

        (c) Create new question papers and specify time limit for each question paper.
        (d) Assign question paper for a particular canidadate along with the test date.
        (e) Evaluate the result of candidate by cross checking his/her answer sheet.
### (2) From candidate point of view candidate can:<br/>

        (b) Attempt the test within the time limits and specified rules.
